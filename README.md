Project Overview: Linear Regression and Cross-Validation
Objective
Analyze a synthetic dataset using linear regression and evaluate the model's performance with cross-validation.

Steps
Generating Sample Data

Generate random values for X and corresponding y values with noise.
Plotting the Generated Data

Visualize the generated data points to understand the data distribution.
Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets

Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Training the Linear Regression Model

Fit a linear regression model to the training data.
Making Predictions

Predict the target variable for both training and test sets using the trained model.
Calculating Performance Metrics

Calculate mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) for both training and test sets.
Plotting the Regression Line

Plot the regression line on the training data.
Plotting Actual vs. Predicted Values

Visualize actual vs. predicted values on the test data.
Performing Cross-Validation

Perform cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance using R-squared scores.
